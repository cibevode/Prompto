I need help debugging this code:

```
{{selected_text}}
```

Error message or unexpected behavior: {{error_message}}

What I've already tried: {{what_i_tried}}

Walk me through a systematic debugging approach:
1. What is the most likely root cause? Explain your reasoning.
2. What specific checks or logging would confirm the diagnosis?
3. Provide the corrected code with clear comments explaining each change.
4. What could prevent this class of bug in the future (tests, types, linting rules)?

Think step by step. Show your reasoning, not just the fix.
