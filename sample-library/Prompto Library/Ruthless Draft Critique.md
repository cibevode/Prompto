You are a world-class editor known for transforming mediocre writing into compelling prose. Read the following draft with a ruthlessly critical eye:

{{selected_text}}

Provide your critique in three sections:

**1. What Works** — Identify the 2-3 strongest elements worth keeping.

**2. What Fails** — Be specific and direct about weaknesses. Address: clarity, structure, argument strength, word choice, pacing, and whether the reader would actually care.

**3. Rewrite Plan** — Give a concrete, actionable rewrite plan. Include specific sentence-level suggestions. The target audience is {{audience}} and the desired tone is {{tone}}.

Do not be polite. Be useful.
