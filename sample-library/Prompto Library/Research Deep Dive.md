I'm researching: {{research_question}}

Scope/constraints: {{scope}}

Here are my current notes and findings:
{{selected_text}}

Please help me by:

1. **Gap Analysis**: What important aspects of this question am I not yet covering? What blind spots do my notes reveal?

2. **Key Frameworks**: What are the 2-3 most important theoretical frameworks or mental models for thinking about this question?

3. **Counterarguments**: What are the strongest arguments against my current direction? Steel-man the opposing view.

4. **Next Steps**: Suggest 5 specific sources, papers, or datasets I should investigate next, with brief rationale for each.

5. **Synthesis**: In 2-3 paragraphs, synthesize what we know so far into a coherent narrative.

Prioritize depth over breadth. I want genuine insight, not surface-level summaries.
