Take the following rough feature idea or user need and expand it into well-structured user stories:

{{selected_text}}

Product context: {{product_context}}

For each user story, provide:
- **Story**: "As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 3-5 testable criteria using Given/When/Then format
- **Edge Cases**: 2-3 edge cases the team should consider
- **Dependencies**: Any technical or product dependencies
- **Estimated Complexity**: S / M / L with brief justification

Generate at least 6 user stories, ordered by priority (must-have → nice-to-have). Group them into logical epics if appropriate.
