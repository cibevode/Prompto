Help me write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the following:

Problem: {{problem}}
Constraints: {{constraints}}

Background context from my notes:
{{selected_text}}

Structure the ADR as:
- **Title**: Short, descriptive decision title
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Context**: The technical and business context driving this decision (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Options Considered**: At least 3 options with pros/cons for each
- **Decision**: The recommended option with clear rationale
- **Consequences**: What changes, what new risks appear, what becomes easier/harder
- **Review Date**: Suggest when this decision should be revisited

Be concrete and technical. Reference specific technologies, patterns, and tradeoffs.
