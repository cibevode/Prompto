Perform a competitive analysis for {{company}} against these competitors: {{competitors}}

Use any context from my notes:
{{selected_text}}

Structure as:

**Market Positioning Map**: Describe where each player sits on the key dimensions (price/quality, features/simplicity, enterprise/consumer, etc.)

**Strengths & Moats**: For each competitor, identify their 2-3 strongest differentiators and any structural advantages.

**Vulnerabilities**: Where is each competitor weakest? What market shifts would hurt them most?

**Opportunity Gaps**: What unserved or underserved needs exist that no competitor fully addresses?

**Strategic Recommendations**: 3 specific, actionable moves based on this analysis.

Be specific and evidence-based, not generic.
