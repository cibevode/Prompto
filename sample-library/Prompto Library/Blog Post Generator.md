Write a compelling blog post about: {{topic}}

Use any context from my notes below as background research:
{{selected_text}}

Requirements:
- Approximately {{word_count}} words
- Hook the reader in the first sentence — no generic openings
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Include at least one surprising insight or counterintuitive point
- End with a clear takeaway, not a generic "in conclusion" paragraph
- Write in a confident, conversational tone — as if explaining to a smart friend over coffee
- Use concrete examples, not abstract platitudes
