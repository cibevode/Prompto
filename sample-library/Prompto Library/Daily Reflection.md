Based on my journal entry / daily notes below, help me reflect and extract value from today:

{{selected_text}}

My current energy level: {{energy_level}}

Guide me through:

**Pattern Recognition**: What patterns do you notice in what I wrote? Any recurring themes, emotions, or concerns?

**Win Acknowledgment**: What did I accomplish or handle well today, even if small?

**Tension Identifier**: Where do I seem conflicted or stuck? Name the tension clearly.

**Tomorrow's Leverage Point**: Based on today, what single action tomorrow would create the most positive momentum?

**Reframe Offer**: If any of my framing seems unhelpfully negative, offer a more constructive way to see the same situation. Don't be toxic-positive — be honestly useful.

Be warm but direct. Talk to me like a wise friend, not a therapist.
