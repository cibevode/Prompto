I want to deeply understand: {{topic}}

My current understanding: {{current_understanding}}

Related notes for context:
{{selected_text}}

Teach me this topic using the following approach:

**Core Insight** (1 sentence): What is the single most important thing to understand?

**Analogy**: Explain the concept using a vivid, memorable analogy that captures the essential mechanism.

**How It Actually Works**: Technical explanation building from my current understanding level. Don't skip steps.

**Common Misconceptions**: What do most people get wrong about this? Correct those misconceptions explicitly.

**The "Aha" Test**: Give me 3 questions I should be able to answer if I truly understand this. Then answer them.

**Go Deeper**: What should I learn next to build on this understanding?

Be precise. If there's nuance or debate in the field, acknowledge it rather than oversimplifying.
