Help me conduct my weekly review. Here are my notes from this week:

{{selected_text}}

My current goals: {{goals}}

Walk me through:

**Completion Audit**: Based on my notes, what did I actually accomplish this week? Be honest — distinguish real output from busy-work.

**Goal Alignment Check**: How well did this week's work align with my stated goals? Score each goal 1-5 for progress made.

**Energy & Focus Analysis**: Where did I seem most engaged vs. drained? What does this suggest about how I should structure next week?

**Unfinished Business**: What's carrying over? For each item, recommend: DO next week / DELEGATE / DELETE / DEFER to specific date.

**Next Week's Top 3**: Based on everything above, what are the three most important things I should focus on next week?

Be concise and actionable. Don't repeat my notes back to me.
